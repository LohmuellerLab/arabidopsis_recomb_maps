This folder contains a genetic map for Arabidopsis thaliana derived from Salome et al 2012: https://doi.org/10.1038/hdy.2011.95

Salome examined crossover frequencies in 17 F2 populations derived from 18 A. thaliana lines and provide genetic maps for 
each of these populations in their "maps K H CF.xls" file here: doi:10.5061/dryad.v655ns36

To get a single map for each chromosome, the Haldane map function distances were converted to recombination rates (cM/Mb)
for each cross and then averaged across the 17 populations using loess. The maps here include these rates but do not include
averaged distances, although a map column of "0"s is included to make sure the files are in the correct HapMap format.
